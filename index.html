     <h3>Cat Children</h3>
     <ul>
       <li><strong>Tinkerbell</strong> ('Tink' or 'Bells')</li>
         <ul>
           <li>After rescuing her from under a bush at Town Hall when she was just a baby, she's become the unofficial mascot for my life. She's terrified of everything but loves to cuddle with the one person she's comfortable around. Me.</li>
         </ul>
       <li><strong>Fernnifer</strong> ('Fern' or 'Fernie')</li>
         <ul>
           <li>Fernie was a 'foster-fail' and is my baby. She unfortunately inherited a defective heart and will most likely not make it past her 4th birthday. As such she gets pretty much anything she wants.</li>
